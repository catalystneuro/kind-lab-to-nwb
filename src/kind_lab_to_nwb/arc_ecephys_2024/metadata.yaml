  experiment_description:
    The experiment investigated fear conditioning in male wild-type and Syngap1+/Delta-GAP rats (n=31, ages 3-6 months).
    Recordings included Local Field Potentials (LFP), electroencephalogram (EEG), head-mounted accelerometer data, and behavioral video recordings across five experimental days.
    The protocol involved context habituation, seizure screening, and a fear conditioning paradigm where rats were exposed to blue flashing light (5 Hz, 110 lux) paired with foot shocks.
    Data were collected using OpenEphys software and a 16-channel Intan digitizing head stage.
    Behavioral paradigm triggers were managed using FreezeFrame software, and behavioral cameras recorded rat movements throughout the experimental sessions.
    The experimental design allowed for assessing neural responses, seizure occurrence, and fear learning in these genetic variants.

Subject:
  species: Rattus norvegicus
  description: Subjects were Evans-SGem2/PWC were genotyped by PCR.
    This study used male rats (n=31, 16 wild-types and 15 Syngap1+/Delta-GAP) bred in-house and maintained in standard housing on a 12h/12h light dark with ad libitum access to water and food.
    Experimental animals were weaned from their dams postnatal day 22 (P22D) and housed with their WT littermates, 2-4 animals per cage.
    Genetically modified males and WT littermates ranging from 3 to 6 months of age were used for all experiments.

    session_description:
      Experimental day 4. Session to probe CS (blue led flash) pre-exposure without fear.
      On experimental day 4, recordings were made while a subset of 19 rats were pre-exposed to 10s of blue flashing light (5 Hz 110 lux flashes, 50 / 50 duty cycle)
      of the same properties as that used for subsequent conditioning and recall, the purpose of this exposure was to test for behavioral and LFP responses to the sensory
      stimuli prior to association with a footshock. Pre-exposure was followed immediately by conditioning.

  Cond:
    session_description:
      Experimental day 4. Conditioning session with paired exposure to CS (blue led flash) and US (footshock).
      Conditioning occurred over a 21 min period and consisted of a 3 min period to allow for exploration of the chamber followed by 6 pairings of a conditioned stimulus (CS)
      co-terminating with the unconditioned stimulus (US).
      In a subset of 13 animals recordings were made in that session.
      The CS was a 10 sec blue flashing light (5 Hz 110 lux flashes, 50 / 50 duty cycle); the US was a 1 sec, 0.8 mA scrambled foot shock delivered through the bars of the floor;
      CS presentations started at 180, 360, 490, 770, 980, and 1280 sec into the training period (Katsenavaki et al 2024).

    session_description:
      Experimental day 5. Fear response assessment session with re-exposure to the CS (blue led flash).
      24 hr after conditioning, on experimental day 5, retention of the conditioned response was tested.
      Recordings were made while rats were placed into the testing context, with a 2 min period to allow for exploration,
      then ten 30 sec long presentations of the CS, separated by 30 sec of CS were given.
