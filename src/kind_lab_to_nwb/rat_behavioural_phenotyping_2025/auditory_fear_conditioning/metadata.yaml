    This experiment is part of the Rat Behavioural Phenotyping Pipeline Methodologies https://sidb.org.uk/facilities/rat-behavioural-phenotyping-pipeline/.
    As an initial effort to characterize the rat lines, these models are being behaviorally phenotyped at SIDB.
    Rat models are phenotyped according to a rigorous pipeline that assesses behaviours relevant to autism with intellectual disability, such as social and motor skills, and learning and sensory processing.
    Different cohorts of rats are run through different subsets of tasks to overcome potential order effects on behaviours and to limit the number of tasks each animal is put through.
    This experiment investigated auditory fear conditioning in different rat models
    (Arid1b: https://rgd.mcw.edu/rgdweb/report/strain/main.html?id=14394518,

    The experimenter was blind to genotype throughout the experiment and watched the trials on a screen from outside the testing room.
    The task utilized two Coulbourn Fear conditioning chambers providing distinct contexts (A and B).
    Rats underwent habituation in context A (2 days), followed by fear conditioning in context B
    where tones were paired with foot shocks. Fear recall was then tested in context A over 2 days.
    Freezing behavior was recorded and analyzed using FreezeFrame 5 software.

  AFC_3_Conditioning:
    session_description: |
      Experimental Day 3. Fear conditioning in context B.
      2 min baseline, then 3 tone presentations (30s, 5kHz, 75-80dB)
      co-terminating with foot shock (0.7mA, 1s).
