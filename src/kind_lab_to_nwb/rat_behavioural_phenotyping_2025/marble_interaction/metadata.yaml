    This experiment is part of the Rat Behavioural Phenotyping Pipeline Methodologies https://sidb.org.uk/facilities/rat-behavioural-phenotyping-pipeline/.
    As an initial effort to characterize the rat lines, these models are being behaviorally phenotyped at SIDB. 
    Rat models are phenotyped according to a rigorous pipeline that assesses behaviours relevant to autism with intellectual disability, such as social and motor skills, and learning and sensory processing. 
    Different cohorts of rats are run through different subsets of tasks to overcome potential order effects on behaviours and to limit the number of tasks each animal is put through.
    This experiment investigated marble interaction behavior in different rat models

    using a plastic box arena (63 x 50 x 30 cm) with wood chip bedding.    
    The experimenter was blind to genotype and monitored trials from outside the testing room via video feed.
    The protocol involved three experimental days: two days of arena habituation (20 min each) followed by a test day with 20 black glass marbles arranged in a 4x5 grid.
    Between rats, the arena was cleared of debris and the wood chip bedding was mixed and flattened out.
    Behavioral data included manual scoring of marble manipulation time using BORIS software and movement tracking using ANY-Maze software.
    The experimental setup included two side-by-side arenas separated by a wooden panel, with CCTV camera recording and controlled lighting conditions (~20 lx).
