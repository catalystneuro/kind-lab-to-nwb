    This experiment is part of the Rat Behavioural Phenotyping Pipeline Methodologies https://sidb.org.uk/facilities/rat-behavioural-phenotyping-pipeline/.
    As an initial effort to characterize the rat lines, these models are being behaviorally phenotyped at SIDB. 
    Rat models are phenotyped according to a rigorous pipeline that assesses behaviours relevant to autism with intellectual disability, such as social and motor skills, and learning and sensory processing. 
    Different cohorts of rats are run through different subsets of tasks to overcome potential order effects on behaviours and to limit the number of tasks each animal is put through.
    This experiment investigated object recognition memory in different rat models 
    (Arid1b: https://rgd.mcw.edu/rgdweb/report/strain/main.html?id=14394518,

    The experimenter was blind to genotype throughout the experiment and watched the trials on a screen from outside the testing room.
    The task utilized a custom-built arena (60x60 cm) with black laminated wood walls and grey lino floor.
    Rats underwent habituation (3 days, 10 min each) followed by sample and test trials to assess their ability to recognize novel objects.
    The protocol included sample trials (15 min with two identical objects) and test trials (3 min) with one novel object.
    Both short-term (5 min delay) and long-term (24 hr delay) memory were assessed.
    Object exploration was recorded via CCTV camera and manually scored using BORIS software.

      Experimental Day 5. Short-term memory test. 
      Two identical objects (e.g. ceramic tea lights, glass ornaments, never face or animal related) 
      were fixed in position (approximately 15 cm from the side and top edge of the arena). 
      A rat was placed individually in the arena with the objects for a 15 min sample trial. 
      The rat was then removed and placed in the holding bucket for 5 min. 
      The objects were removed from the arena, the arena was cleaned with 70% ethanol and the objects 
      replaced with a replica object and one novel object (counterbalanced for location and object between rats). 
      The rat was returned to the arena for a 3 min test trial, 5 min after the sample trial.
