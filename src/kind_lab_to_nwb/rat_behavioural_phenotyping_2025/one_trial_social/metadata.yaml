    This experiment is part of the Rat Behavioural Phenotyping Pipeline Methodologies https://sidb.org.uk/facilities/rat-behavioural-phenotyping-pipeline/.
    As an initial effort to characterize the rat lines, these models are being behaviorally phenotyped at SIDB. 
    Rat models are phenotyped according to a rigorous pipeline that assesses behaviours relevant to autism with intellectual disability, such as social and motor skills, and learning and sensory processing. 
    Different cohorts of rats are run through different subsets of tasks to overcome potential order effects on behaviours and to limit the number of tasks each animal is put through.
    This experiment investigated social interaction behavior in different rat models 
    (Arid1b: https://rgd.mcw.edu/rgdweb/report/strain/main.html?id=14394518,

    The experimenter was, blind to genotype throughout, watched the trials on a screen from a separate room, and was ready to intervene if any aggressive behaviour was seen (wrestling and audible vocalisations, very rare).
    The task utilized a custom-built arena (60x60 cm) with white laminated wood walls and floor.
    Rats underwent habituation in groups and individually, followed by a test trial where they
    interacted with an unfamiliar same-sex rat. Social exploration was recorded via overhead
    camera and ultrasonic vocalizations were recorded during test trials.
    Videos were scored using BORIS software to manually quantify the time that the test rat spent engaged in social exploration of the stimulus rat (nose within whisking distance, grooming, climbing on, placing paws on, boxing with, following closely or pinning the stimulus rat). Activity was tracked using ANYmaze to generate distance moved and % time in different zones of the arena (e.g. center and outer periphery during the habituation trials when the other rat was not present).

      Experimental Day 1. The test subject and the rat it was to be paired with 
      (stimulus rats, which was unfamiliar same sex and strain and within 1-3 wks of age of the test rats) 
      was also placed in cage groups into the arena twice for 10 min, with approximately 1-2 hr between sessions.

      Experimental Day 2. Second group habituation.
      Test subject was placed in arena for 10 min.

      Experimental Day 3. Individual habituation.
      The subject received a test trial of 15 min duration in which the rat was placed into the arena for 5 min, 
      and then an unfamiliar same-sex rat was introduced to the arena into the opposite corner to which the test rat was. 
      After 10 min together, the test rat was removed from arena first and placed into a clean holding cage to avoid transferring any odours to his cage mates. 
      Then the stimulus rat was then removed and placed back into its home cage. 
      Stimulus rats could be used up to two times with different test rats within a day, with at least 1 hr between trials. 
      Stimulus rats were not used in more than 3 experiments.
