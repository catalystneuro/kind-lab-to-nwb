    This experiment is part of the Rat Behavioural Phenotyping Pipeline Methodologies https://sidb.org.uk/facilities/rat-behavioural-phenotyping-pipeline/.
    As an initial effort to characterize the rat lines, these models are being behaviorally phenotyped at SIDB. 
    Rat models are phenotyped according to a rigorous pipeline that assesses behaviours relevant to autism with intellectual disability, such as social and motor skills, and learning and sensory processing. 
    Different cohorts of rats are run through different subsets of tasks to overcome potential order effects on behaviours and to limit the number of tasks each animal is put through.
    This experiment investigated prey capture behavior in different rat models

    The experimenter, not present in the same room as the rat during any of the trials, watched the trials on a screen from an anti-room. Experimenters were blind to genotype during all experiments and scoring of video trials. 
    The task utilized a large square arena (100x100 cm) with white walls and wood-lined floor.
    Rats underwent habituation (5 days), including exposure to dead crickets, followed by
    live cricket hunting trials over 5 days (4 trials per day, 2 min max duration).
    Silent brown crickets (25-30 mm; bought fresh for each experiment from LiveFoodsDirect UK) were maintained in large plastic boxes with access to hydration gel (ProRep bug gel, LiveFoods Direct, UK) and fresh food (e.g. carrot, potatoes, bran flakes, cat biscuits) and only healthy crickets (no signs of disease, all appendages present) were used in the experiments. Crickets were placed in a smaller container and placed on a heat mat for at least 10 min prior to use, to encourage fleeing. Ins t holding tongs (Bug tongs, Forest School Shop UK) were used to manipulate crickets.
    Performance was recorded via overhead camera and ultrasonic vocalizations were recorded.
    Measures included latency to intercept, catch, and eat crickets, as well as movement tracking.

      Week 2 Experimental Day 1. Live cricket hunting.
      4 trials per day, 2 min max duration per trial.
      Rat in starting cylinder 15s, live cricket placed in opposite corner.
      The rat was given 2 min to catch the cricket. 
      The rat was removed from the arena when the cricket was eaten or if the 2 min trial duration elapsed 
      (whichever happens first). Crickets were not reused. 
      The arena was cleared of all debris and wiped with water between trials. 
      Rats were held in the holding bucket between trials, the intertrial interval was approx. 1-2 min.
